Different directives are used to assign work to these threads. At the end of the parallel region, threads synchronize, forming again a single thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the above example. **worker creation** is achieved through the `#pragma omp parallel num_threads(10)` directive. It allows to create 10 threads. Each worker is associated with an identifier, obtained through the `omp_get_thread_num()` function call. **Work assignment** is achieved through the code in the region enclosed by the brackets `{...}`. All threads are executing the same set of instructions, in this case only `printf(\"hello from thread %d\\n\",...);`. Notice that having a different identifier allows for each thread to access different data, or follow different paths. Finally **Worker synchronization and coordination** is relatively simple in this example, since there's not much communication between them. However, at the end of the parallel region, all workers must wait for each other to finish before continuing with the sequential code. "

If you're running this in a machine that has multiple threads, I expect you to see a number less than 10000. Moreover, multiple executions may lead to different results. This is what is known as a **data race**. It occurs because reading i, incrementing, and writting to i are three different instructions. Therefore, it is possible for two threads to write the same value of i, increment it and obtain the same value twice.\n",
