This API function returns true if the execution environment is the same device that innitiated the target region, i.e. the host. The `omp target` directive does not expose any parallelism per-se. Instead, it tells the compiler that the enclosed region is meant to execute in the device. The compiler will generate different versions of the same code, for different possible devices. Notice that target regions are not necessarily executed on the accelerator device (i.e. GPU in our case). It is still possible to control if target regions are executed in the host as well.
