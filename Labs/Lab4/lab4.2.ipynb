    "A GPU often contains a large number of cores. These cores are grouped together into sets, each named **Streaming Multiprocessor (SM)**. Each streaming multiprocessor contains a local memory that can be shared across the cores that belong to the same SM. Each core may also contain private memory (e.g. registers, and L1 cache), but these are not exposed to OpenMP. SMs are connected through a global GPU memory that supports atomic operations. We showed an example of this in the slides, feel free to refer to this example. \n",

    "We can use different tools, either specific to the vendor (e.g. `nvidia-smi` and `rocm-info`) or to the compiler. Let's take a look at the GPUs in your system from the perspective of the LLVM compiler runtime using `llvm-omp-device-info`:\n"

    "So far in this tutorial we have been using `#pragma omp target` to specify a region of code to be executed in the device. However, it is important to understand that, if you are only using target, your code is running in the GPU, but it does not mean it is running in parallel. GPU cores are often slower and less robust than CPU cores. So just adding your application to a target region will most likely result in a considerable slow down in the execution time. \n",

An scheduling of `schedule(2)`, will create chunks of two iterations and assign it to each thread. For example for the above iteration space of 9 iterations, a clause `schedule(2)` will result in the following distribution of the iteration space.\n",
