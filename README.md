This repository contains the Labs for an OpenMP tutorial.

Slides can be found in this [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B0wbwK093r7JflVKSXg0bmtuSDVHaW9vQ0o2aWVQeTI4RW55MVhMWkhMdTZCSVVpaEZ3eDA?resourcekey=0-cccfTsDi-rfbmt-b02CpoQ&usp=drive_link)

This is work in progress and it still does not cover the whole specification. The complete envision sillabus is in the google drive folder above. The current status is part 1 and part 4, with its respective labs in this repository. 

Feel free to suggest changes and fix stuff.
